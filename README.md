# CareSource
A Java project for hospital administration.
This project is a group project for the object oriented programming with Java class at Northeastern University.
My contribution to this project is to assign doctors of different specialities based on their availability. Each of 6 department has 3 doctors and 
in a day a doctor can be assigned to only four patients. 
Each doctor class extends Person class and implements AbstractDoctor interface. I used simple factory pattern to create doctor objects by using 
Doctorfactory which implements from AbstractDoctorFactory interface.Intially I designed my project to work with CSV files and then
I changed it to work with MySQL.
